    "Assumptions\n",
    "1. Cost increases per linear foot drilled\n",
    "2. Recovery per foot decreases as over a number of feet increases\n",
    "3. More risk with drilling horizontally; however it is a lot better than drilling new holes every time\n",
    "4. Geographic clustering of drilling data could lead us to different projections\n",
    "5. Higher proppant PPF/frac fluid theoretically leads to more recovery.  Not an assumption - higher costs as proppant PPF goes up."
