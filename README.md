We are building a predictive model on the relationship between oil recovery 
and the lateral length of wells in the Permian Basin without using complex geological parameters.
We hypothesize that as the lateral length increases, the productivity per foot decreases in a non-linear manner.
We further hypothesize that we can predict horizontal well recovery based on vertical performance 
and that models can be built to fit different regions of the Permian.
