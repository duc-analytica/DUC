# Codeup Capstone Project:  
We are building a predictive model on the relationship between oil recovery and the lateral length of wells without using complex geological parameters. We hypothesize that as the lateral length increases, the productivity per foot decreases in a non-linear manner. We further opine that horizontal well performance can be predicted from vertical wells.
