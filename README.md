Codeup Capstone Project  - DUC Analytica:
    We are building a predictive model on the relationship between oil recovery
and the lateral length of wells without using complex geological parameters.
    We hypothesize that as the lateral length increases, the productivity per foot 
decreases in a non-linear manner.
    We further opine that horizontal well performance can be predicted from vertical wells.
